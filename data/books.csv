Wayne Thom,Photographing the Late Modern,Emily Bills,,Monograph,"<p class=""font_8"">The first monograph of photographer Wayne Thom, whose documentation of Late Modern architecture constitutes an architectural/visual archive unlike any other.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">A crucial primer to late-twentieth-century Modernism, this monograph devoted to Wayne Thom chronicles his photographic practice and the architectural and urban environment in which he worked. An innovative chronicler of the booming West Coast urbanism of the 1960s and 70s, Thom's photographs of key projects by path-breaking architecture firms such as William Pereira &amp; Associates, Edward Durell Stone, SOM, Gio Ponti, John Portman, I. M. Pei, and A. Quincy Jones helped establish the idea of cool architectural glamour of the era.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Raised in Hong Kong, Thom moved to California in the mid-1960s and trained in the technical craftsmanship of photography, adept at harnessing natural light for both interior and exterior compositions. He soon began working with the figures who would become his clients and benefactors, most importantly William Pereira and A. Quincy Jones, a prolific architect and Dean of the School of Architecture at USC.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">As Emily Bills critically assess Thom's career, she demonstrates that his photography became inseparable from Late Modernism in the popular imagination, a period of architectural production that ran from the late 1960s through the 1980s. <em>Wayne Thom: Photographing the Late Modern</em> is a celebration of this key architectural photographer and a unique chronicle of the works of this transformative period of architectural expression.</p>",,,

Heroic,Concrete Architecture and the New Boston,"Chris Grimley, Michael Kubo & Mark Pasnik",2015,History & Preservation,"<p class=""font_8""><strong>A key primer to the broad range of ground-breaking concrete architecture - inclusive of, but well beyond, brutalism - as it developed in its most accommodating city, Boston, and an important contribution to the efforts to preserve the built legacy of this era.</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Often problematically labeled as "Brutalist" architecture, the concrete buildings that transformed Boston during 1960s and 1970s were conceived with progressive-minded intentions by some of the world's most influential designers, including Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, I. M. Pei, Henry Cobb, Araldo Cossutta, Gerhard Kallmann and Michael McKinnell, Paul Rudolph, Josep Lluís Sert, and The Architects Collaborative.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">As a worldwide phenomenon, building with concrete represents one of the major architectural movements of the postwar years, but in Boston it was deployed in more numerous and diverse civic, cultural, and academic projects than in any other major U.S. city. After decades of stagnation and corrupt leadership, public investment in Boston in the 1960s catalyzed enormous growth, resulting in a generation of bold buildings that shared a vocabulary of concrete modernism.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">The period from the 1960 arrival of Edward J. Logue as the powerful and often controversial director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority to the reopening of Quincy Market in 1976 saw Boston as an urban laboratory for the exploration of concrete's structural and sculptural qualities. What emerged was a vision for the city's widespread revitalization often referred to as the "New Boston."</p>
<p class=""font_8"">Today, when concrete buildings across the nation are in danger of insensitive renovation or demolition, Heroic presents the concrete structures that defined Boston during this remarkable period - from the well-known (Boston City Hall, New England Aquarium, and cornerstones of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University) to the already lost (Mary Otis Stevens and Thomas F. McNulty's concrete Lincoln House and Studio; Sert, Jackson &amp; Associates' Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School) - with hundreds of images; essays by architectural historians Joan Ockman, Lizabeth Cohen, Keith N. Morgan, and Douglass Shand-Tucci; and interviews with a number of the architects themselves.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">The product of eight years of research and advocacy, Heroic surveys the intentions and aspirations of this period and considers anew its legacies - both troubled and inspired.</p>","<p class=""font_8"">This should have infromation about fonts and things.</p>",,"Boston Preservation Alliance, docomomo US"

Hamptons Modern,Contemporary Living on the East End,David Sokol,2022,Editorial,"<p class=""font_8""><strong>A visual celebration of New York's legendary summer retreat as the vanguard of residential design today.</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8"">There are few places in the United States that have experienced as many waves of American modernism as Long Island's East End, long known as a haven for the wealthy and glamorous. In Hamptons Modern, author David Sokol explores the latest architectural experiments taking place in New York's legendary summer retreat. With contemporary design increasingly favored in the region, the eighteen residences featured here reflect modernism's spread across both forks (and as far west as Bellport, which has become a cultural gateway to the Hamptons).</p>
<p class=""font_8"">Yet perhaps more important, these houses represent a shift away from the image of conspicuously sprawling properties for the elite; these projects return to modernism's founding principles, shun Instagrammable spectacle, and steward the East End's increasingly fragile landscape.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">These houses interface with the seaside landscape in ways that reference the Hamptons' rich design history and sensitively highlight Long Island's famed natural beauty. Some are renovations and additions to houses by famed twentieth-century modernists like Andrew Geller, Charles Gwathmey, and Norman Jaffe, and leading offices such as Bates Masi + Architects, Young Projects, Leroy Street Studio, and Ryall Sheridan Architects represent the contemporary approach to twenty-first century regionalism. Hamptons Modern presents these and numerous other examples of designforward residences that are responsive to terrain, building vernacular, and cultural legacy.</p>","<ul class=""font_8"">

Louis Kahn,Architecture as Philosophy,John Lobell,2020,Architecture & Philosophy,"<p class=""font_8""><strong>For everyone interested in the enduring appeal of Louis Kahn, this book demonstrates that a close look at how Kahn put his buildings together will reveal a deeply felt philosophy.</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Louis I. Kahn is one of the most influential and poetic architects of the twentieth century, a figure whose appeal extends beyond the realm of specialists.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">In this book, noted Kahn expert John Lobell explores how Kahn's focus on structure, respect for materials, clarity of program, and reverence for details come together to manifest an overall philosophy. Kahn's work clearly conveys a kind of ""transcendent rootedness"" - a rootedness in the fundamentals of architecture that also asks soaring questions about our experience of light and space, and even how we fit into the world.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">In <em>Louis Kahn: Architecture as Philosophy</em>, John Lobell seeks to reveal how Kahn's buildings speak to grand humanistic concerns. Through examinations of five of Kahn's great buildings - the Richards Medical Research Building in Philadelphia; the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla; the Phillips Exeter Academy Library in New Hampshire; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth; and the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven - Lobell presents a clear but detailed look at how the way these buildings are put together presents Kahn's philosophy, including how Kahn wishes us to experience them.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">An architecture book that touches on topics that addresses the universal human interests of consciousness and creativity, Louis Kahn: Architecture as Philosophy helps us understand our place and the nature of well-being in the built environment.</p>",,,

With more than thirty projects built or under construction and some 200,000 people served, MASS has pioneered an immersive approach in the practice of architecture that provides the infrastructure, buildings, and physical systems necessary for growth, dignity, and well-being, while always engaging local communities with attention to the specifics of cultural context and social needs.</p>",,,
Words & Works,Scenes from a Life in Architecture,Henry N. Cobb,2018,Architectural History & Monograph,"<p class=""font_8""><strong>The first book dedicated to the career of the preeminent American architect, Henry N. Cobb.</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">As a builder, teacher, and mentor, Henry N. Cobb has been one of the most eloquent voices in architecture for well over half a century. A founding partner of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, where he has worked actively and continuously since its inception in 1955, his practice encompasses a wide variety of building types, with projects across the world that resound in the public imagination.</p>

Imagining the Modern,Architecture and Urbanism of the Pittsburgh Renaissance,"Chris Grimley, Rami el Samahy & Michael Kubo",,Architectural History,"<p class=""font_8""><strong>Imagining the Modern explores Pittsburgh's ambitious modern architecture and urban renewal program that made it a gem of American postwar cities, and set the stage for its stature today.</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">In the 1950s and '60s an ambitious program of urban revitalization transformed Pittsburgh and became a model for other American cities. Billed as the Pittsburgh Renaissance, this era of superlatives - the city claimed the tallest aluminum clad building, the world's largest retractable dome, the tallest steel structure - developed through visionary mayors and business leaders, powerful urban planning authorities, and architects and urban designers of international renown, including Frank Lloyd Wright, I.M. Pei, Mies van der Rohe, SOM, and Harrison &amp; Abramovitz. These leaders, civic groups, and architects worked together to reconceive the city through local and federal initiatives that aimed to address the problems that confronted Pittsburgh's postwar development.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">Initiated as an award-winning exhibition at the Carnegie Museum of Art in 2014, Imagining the Modern untangles this complicated relationship with modern architecture and planning through a history of Pittsburgh's major sites, protagonists, and voices of intervention. Through original documentation, photographs and drawings, as well as essays, analytical drawings, and interviews with participants, this book provides a nuanced view of this crucial moment in Pittsburgh's evolution. Addressing both positive and negative impacts of the era, Imagining the Modern examines what took place during the city's urban renewal era, what was gained and lost, and what these histories might suggest for the city's future.</p>

Breuer's Bohemia,"The Architect, His Circle, and Midcentury Houses in New England",James Crump,2021,Architectural History,"<p class=""font_8""><em><strong>Breuer's Bohemia</strong></em><strong> explores a vibrant period of midcentury modern design and culture as seen through the influential New England houses designed by Marcel Breuer for his circle of clients and friends.</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">The iconic twentieth-century architect Marcel Breuer was a prolific designer of residential architecture, which is often overshadowed by his early renown as a Bauhaus furniture maker and his large-scale projects. Breuer's Bohemia surveys the houses he designed in Connecticut and Massachusetts from the 1950s through the '70s, many of which were commissioned by a few culturally progressive clients—chiefly Rufus and Leslie Stillman and Andrew and Jamie Gagarin—who coalesced around him into a dynamic social circle. Included in this scene were prominent cultural figures such as Alexander Calder, Arthur Miller, Francine du Plessix Gray, Philip Roth, and William Styron, and more, marking a unique intersection of postwar architecture, art, and letters.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">The publication of <em>Breuer's Bohemia</em> coincides with the feature-length documentary of the same name by author and filmmaker James Crump, exploring Breuer's explosive residential practice on the East Coast.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">Through original research and interviews, the voices of principal characters from Breuer's circle and notable figures from the field of architecture help tell the story of Breuer's collaborations with his friends and clients, breathing new life into the history of the rich cultural atmosphere of which they all played a vital part.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">Heavily illustrated with vintage and contemporary photographs as well as rarely seen archival materials, <em>Breuer's Bohemia</em> is a unique glimpse of a twentieth-century milieu that produced an aesthetic, intellectual, and sometimes sybaritic community during a fertile period of American design and culture.</p>",,,
